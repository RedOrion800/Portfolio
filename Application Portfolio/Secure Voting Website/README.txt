This website is part of a group project in which I am the project manager, the manager of the GitHub repository, and a UI designer.
The candidate create form adds candidates to the database, and the running create form adds candidates to polls.
The running creation form gives every candidate that is not running in an election yet.
The Javascript in the running creation form ensures that both of the dropdowns have a selected item, and that the states of both the candidate and the poll match or that the poll is a US election.
